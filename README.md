- This is a module, so you will need to flash it. It works on Magisk, KernelSU, and APatch.
- You can find the `android_enhancer.log` file in Internal Storage/Android. It will show you the types of tweaks Android Enhancer has applied.
- The device may overheat while the tweaks are being executed, but there's no need to worry. The overheating will subside after some time, once the tweaks are fully completed.
